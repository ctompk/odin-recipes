        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>For the rice bowls</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 lbs (908 g) boneless skinless chicken thighs</li>
            <li>4 cups (600 g) cooked rice</li>
            <li>12 oz (340 g) broccoli</li>
            <li>3 medium (150 g) carrots</li>
            <li>1 small (125 g) onion</li>
            <li>4 stalks (50 g) green onions</li>
            <li>½ tbsp (7.5 g) minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 tbsp (15 g) oil</li>
            <li>oil spray</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For the sauce</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tbsp (45 g) soy sauce (gluten-free if needed)</li>
            <li>1½ tbsp (23 g) lime juice</li>
            <li>2½ tbsp (40 g) sriracha</li>
            <li>2 tsp (10 g) sesame oil</li>
            <li>¼ cup (84 g) honey</li>
            <li>½ tbsp (7.5 g) garlic</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <h3>For the rice</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook enough rice to yield 4 cups (600g) of cooked rice. 1 cup of
            dry rice will make between 2-3 cups of rice depending on what kind
            you use.</li>
            </ol>
        <h3>For the sauce</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mince some garlic cloves until you have 1 tbsp (15g) of
            garlic.</li>
            <li>Place a bowl over a scale and add in the soy sauce, lime juice,
            sriracha, sesame oil, honey, and ½ tbsp of the garlic.</li>
            <li>Stir the sauce until the the honey is incorporated and the
            garlic is distributed throughout.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>For the chicken</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 425°F (217°C).</li>
            <li>Place the chicken thighs into a large bowl. Cut off any excess
            fat or skin from the thighs.</li>
            <li>Pour roughly ⅓-½ of the sauce over the top of the chicken and
            mix it with the chicken until it is completely coated. Allowing it
            to marinate for 30 minutes to aa couple of hours is best but if you
            want to just cook it immediately, that will do.</li>
            <li>Line a sheet pan with foil and lay the chicken thighs smooth
            side down on the sheet pan, ensuring enough space between each thigh
            to promote proper browning.</li>
            <li>Roast the chicken for 10-12 minutes.</li>
            <li>After 10-12 minutes, turn the oven to broil and place the sheet
            pan on the top rack, under the broiler if it is not already there.
            Watch the chicken closely as it will be prone to burning.</li>
            <li>Broil the chicken for 3-5 minutes on each side until you are
            happy with the level of browning on the chicken.</li>
            <li>Once finished, remove from the oven and allow it to rest before
            cutting.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>For the vegetables</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>While the chicken is cooking, wash and cut all of your
            vegetables.</li>
            <li>Cut the onion into thin slices, the carrots into a medium dice
            on a bias, the broccoli into small florets, and the green onions
            into thin slices. Save the green onion tops for a garnish and add
            the whites to your onion pile.</li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium high heat and add in ½ tbsp of
            oil. Add in the carrots and broccoli first. Cook them for a few
            minutes to develop a small amount of browning and then drizzle over
            a few tablespoons of water to create steam and help them cook a bit
            faster.</li>
            <li>Create some room in the center of the skillet and add the
            remaining ½ tbsp of oil. Dump in the onions and garlic. Cook for a
            couple of minutes until the onions just start to develop some color
            and then mix into the rest of the vegetables.</li>
            <li>Measure out 4 cups (600g) of cooked rice and add to the
            skillet.</li>
            <li>Pour over the remaining sauce and mix to combine.</li>
            <li>Toss the chicken thighs around on the sheet pan to coat them in
            any juices/sauce on the pan. Cut the chicken into a medium dice and
            add to skillet.</li>
            <li>Mix everything together and taste test. Adjust flavor with salt,
            pepper, or any of the sauce components as you see fit.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Plating</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The recipe makes 5 servings. Divide the contents of the skillet
            evenly into the 5 containers. This meal will last for up to 5 days
            in the fridge.</li>
            <li>Reheat in the microwave and top with more sriracha.</li>
        </ol>
