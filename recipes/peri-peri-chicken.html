        <h3>This is a great spicy marinade recipe, a traditional African dish,
        great for BBQ. Nice with salad and fries, but I like adding it to a pita
        with salad and garlic Greek yogurt (3/4 cup Greek yogurt and 3 cloves of
        crushed garlic with finely chopped chives). Don't go on a date though,
        gives you wicked garlic breath!</h3>
        <p>This peri peri chicken recipe smothers chicken in a homemade peri
        peri sauce then bakes or grills them and serves them with extra sauce.
        It's a quick and easy weeknight meal.</p>
